# Automatic Shading Systems

A full‚Äëstack project for managing areas, maps, and shading devices with alerts and dashboards.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- MySQL 8+ (or compatible)

## Repository Layout
- `client/` ‚Äî Vite + React frontend
- `server/` ‚Äî Express backend (MySQL via mysql2)
- `server/uploads/maps/` ‚Äî Stored map files (ignored in VCS)
- `shade_system_test.sql` ‚Äî Database schema and minimal seed

## 1) Database Setup
1. Create the database and tables:
   - Open MySQL client and run:
```sql
SOURCE shade_system_test.sql;
```
2. Ensure a user exists with permissions to the new database.

## 2) Backend Setup
```
cd server
npm install
```
Create a `.env` file in `server/`:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=shade_system_test
DB_PORT=3306
```
Start the server:
```
npm start
```
- API base: `http://localhost:3001`
- CORS allows `http://localhost:5173`

## 3) Frontend Setup
```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
- App runs at `http://localhost:5173`

## 4) Login Credentials
All demo accounts use password: **password123**

### 7. **Devices**
   - Admin: Can add/delete
   - Maintenance: Can add/delete
   - Planner: Can only control positions in assigned areas

### 8. **Automatic Scheduling** üÜï

The system includes a production-ready automatic scheduler that executes device schedules in real-time.

#### How It Works:

1. **Create a Schedule** (Admin/Maintenance only):
   - Open Configure mode for an area
   - Click on a device
   - Click "Add Schedule"
   - Fill in:
     - **Name**: "Morning Open", "Evening Close", etc.
     - **Day**: Daily or specific day (Monday-Sunday)
     - **Start Time**: When to begin (e.g., 07:00)
     - **End Time**: When to end (e.g., 09:00)
     - **Target Position**: Device position (0=closed, 100=open)

2. **Intelligent Automatic Execution** (Phase 2 - Smart Override Detection):
   - Scheduler runs every 2 minutes (configurable)
   - **Executes once per day at start_time** (not continuously)
   - **Detects manual overrides** - Skips execution if user changed device within 30 minutes
   - After execution, users maintain full manual control
   - Automatically resumes next matching day
   - Logs all executions and skips to activity log
   - Respects device status (skips inactive/maintenance devices)

3. **Example Schedule (Phase 2 - Intelligent Behavior)**:
   ```
   Name: "Morning Open"
   Day: Daily
   Start: 07:00
   End: 09:00
   Position: 100% (fully open)
   
   Scenario A - No User Intervention:
   07:00 ‚Üí Schedule executes ‚Üí Device opens to 100%
   07:30 ‚Üí User manually changes to 50%
   07:32 ‚Üí System respects change (no override)
   Next day 07:00 ‚Üí Device opens to 100% again
   
   Scenario B - User Pre-sets (NEW in Phase 2):
   06:40 ‚Üí User manually sets device to 50%
   07:00 ‚Üí Schedule detects recent manual change (20 min ago)
         ‚Üí SKIPS execution for today
         ‚Üí Device stays at 50% (user's choice respected)
         ‚Üí Activity log: "Schedule skipped: Manual override detected"
   Next day 07:00 ‚Üí Schedule executes again (if no manual change)
   
   ‚úÖ Automation sets initial state when needed
   ‚úÖ Detects and respects user intent
   ‚úÖ Users can prevent automation by manual pre-set
   ‚úÖ Intelligent, context-aware behavior
   ```

4. **Activity Logging**:
   - All schedule executions are logged
   - Shows in activity log: "Schedule 'Morning Open' executed: Device Name ‚Üí 100%"
   - Tracks which user created the schedule

5. **Professional Schedule Management**:
   - **Pause/Enable Toggle** - Temporarily disable schedules without deleting
   - **Visual Status Indicators** - See at a glance which schedules are active/paused
   - **Quick Controls** - Pause button for emergencies or maintenance
   - **Activity Logging** - All pause/enable actions tracked
   - Only executes on 'active' schedules
   - Skips devices that are 'under_maintenance' or 'inactive'
   
6. **Smart Schedule Behavior** (Professional Design):
   - **At Start Time** (e.g., 07:00): Schedule executes once, sets device position
   - **After Execution**: User has full manual control, changes are respected
   - **End Time** (e.g., 09:00): No action, device maintains current position
   - **Next Day**: Schedule executes again at start time
   - **Emergency Override**: Pause button available for Admin/Maintenance
   - **Best of Both Worlds**: Automation convenience + User control

#### Testing the Scheduler:

**Quick Test:**
1. Login as Admin (alice@campus.edu)
2. Create a schedule for 2 minutes from now
   - Example: If it's 15:30, create schedule 15:32-15:35
3. Wait for the time to arrive
4. Watch the device position change automatically
5. Check activity log for execution record

**Production Use Cases:**
- **Morning Open**: 07:00-09:00 ‚Üí Open all classroom shades
- **Midday Shade**: 12:00-14:00 ‚Üí Partial close to reduce glare
- **Evening Close**: 18:00-20:00 ‚Üí Close all shades for security
- **Weekend Mode**: Saturday/Sunday ‚Üí Different schedule

#### Scheduler Status (Admin API):
```bash
# Check if scheduler is running
GET /api/schedules/status

# Manually trigger execution (testing)
POST /api/schedules/execute-now
```

## Notes
- `server/uploads/maps/` is ignored by git and created at runtime
- To reset DB, re‚Äërun `shade_system_test.sql`

## Build
- Frontend production build: `cd client && npm run build`
- Backend runs via `node server/index.js`
